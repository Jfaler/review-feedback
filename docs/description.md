This is a fork of an add-on which was removed from AnkiWeb in early 2017. The original was most likely written by nest0r/Ja-Dark who [apparently deleted all of their shared Anki resources](https://web.archive.org/web/20190309073252/https://forum.koohii.com/thread-14570.html). There is no way to tell for sure since the original add-on description did not contain a copyright notice or attribution to a specific author.
